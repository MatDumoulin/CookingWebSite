        Hi, my name is Mathieu Dumoulin and I'm the awesome man behind this website.
        I'm developing it in my spare time. For the moment, some functionalities are
        not yet implemented. This site is only meant to run on a desktop
        computer. The user interface may look weird if used on a mobile device.
        Before having fun with the site, it is important to note that I will delete all data
        created before launching this website.
